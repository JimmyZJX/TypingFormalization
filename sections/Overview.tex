\section{Overview}

\bruno{I think some text/ideas-for-text can be borrowed from ITP.}

\subsection{DK's Declarative System}
Subtyping and Typing. \jimmy{Can you prepare the figures. Subtyping is already in ITP.}

\paragraph{Metatheory} Talk about the lemmas that are false, show counterexample. 

\paragraph{Other Challenges} Scoping, Output Contexts?

\subsection{Small-Step Unification} Mention some algorithms for unification for 
dependent types that use a small-step approach. Credit them later for some ideas that 
we also employ.

Some issues to point out: Duplicated contexts (rather than shared contexts), which make 
the formalization harder since requires ``synchronizing'' things ...

\subsection{Worklist Algorithm for Subtyping}

Revise the approach in ITP.

\paragraph{Scoping Garbage} Scoping problems (extra garbage).

\paragraph{No Inference Judgments} 
Only subtyping (which is a \emph{checking} judgment). 
No approach to deal with \emph{inference} judgments.

\subsection{Algorithmic Type Inference for Higher-Ranked Types: Key Ideas}

Our algorithm borrows some ideas from previous work, while adding new ones. 
A small-step style processing worklists; \emph{Judgment Chains}; others. 

Importantly we now deal with inference judgement.
