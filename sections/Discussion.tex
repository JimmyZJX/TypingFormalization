\subsection{Making DK's scoping more precise}\label{sec:discussion:scoping}

DK's algorithm deals with garbage variables in a different approach,
as discussed in Section~\ref{ssec:DK_Algorithm},
through type variables or existential variable markers.
However, there is still a chance that
unused existential variables leak to output context and accumulate infinitely.
For example, the derivation of the judgment $(\lam x)~() \Lto 1$ is as follows
$$
\inferrule*
{
    \inferrule*
    {
        \inferrule*
        {
            \inferrule*
            {\ldots x \To \al \ldots \\ \ldots \al \le \bt \ldots}
            {\Gm, \al, \bt, x:\al \vdash x \Lto \bt \dashv \Gm_1, x:\al}
        }
        {\Gm \vdash \lam x \To \al \to \bt \dashv \Gm_1}
        \\
        \inferrule*
        {\ldots () \Lto \al \ldots}
        {\Gm_1 \vdash \appInf{\al \to \al}{()}{\al} \dashv \Gm_2}
    }
    {\Gm \vdash (\lam x)~() \To \al \dashv \Gm_2}
    \\
    \inferrule*
    {~}
    {\Gm_2 \vdash 1 \le 1 \dashv \Gm_2}
}
{\Gm \vdash (\lam x)~() \Lto 1 \dashv \Gm, \al = 1, \bt = \al}
$$
where $\Gm_1 := (\Gm, \al, \bt = \al$) solves $\bt$,
and $\Gm_2 := (\Gm, \al = 1, \bt = \al$) solves both $\al$ and $\bt$.

If the reader is not familiar with DK's algorithm,
he/she might be confused about the inconsistent types across judgment.
As an example, $(\lam x)~()$ synthesizes $\al$,
but the second premise of the subsumption rule uses $1$ for the result.
This is because a context application $[\Gm,\al=1,\bt=\al]\al = 1$ happens between the premises.

The existential variables $\al$ and $\bt$ are clearly not used after the subsumption rule,
but according to the algorithm, they are kept in the context
until some parent judgment recycles a block of variables,
or to the very end of a type inference task.
In that sense, DK's algorithm does not control the scoping of variables precisely enough.
%However, it is a minor issue that does not affect the soundness and completeness properties.
