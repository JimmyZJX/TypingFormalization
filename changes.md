A Mechanical Formalization of Higher-Ranked Polymorphic Type Inference
---

- We addressed several minor issues pointed out by the reviewers.
- Well-formedness definitions are now formally given.
- More descriptions on the proof scripts are given, including the different encoding of the algorithmic rules (small-step v.s. big-step)
and a translation table in Appendix.
- We added a subsection (Section 5.3) reporting an extension of the system with scoped type variables
- A related work, _The Essence of ML Type Inference_, is added to the Related Work
